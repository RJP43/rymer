                        <p>First appears in the April 10th issue, a Scottish girl described thus: "a
                           young and frank-looking girl of some twenty years of age--her face pale
                           with anxiety, but a look of courage and determination in her blue eyes
                           that was a joy to see--brought a soldier's musket to the charge and stood
                           resolutely on the defensive. Her dress was picturesque, for she wore a
                           foraging cap with a gold band and tassel, from beneath which, in long
                           wavy masses, escaped her fair hair, which was of that beautiful colour
                           called golden in the north, and upon which the light from the Hindoo's
                           torch shone as if there were literally threads of gold interwoven among
                           it. A scarf of tartan was wound tightly about her, and set off her fine
                           figure to advantage. Her atititude<!--sic--> combined grace with dignity;
                           and there was a chivalric courage about her, as she there stood with the
                           musket at the charge, and the bayonet gleaming in the flickering light
                           from the Hindoo's torch, that would have won the admiration of a
                           painter." Jessie reveals that she is the daughter of a soldier. She in in love with

                        <p>Originally, a pseudohistorical character well known in late 1857 and
                           throughout 1858. A fraudulent 'letter to the Editor', printed in several
                           British, Irish, and American newspapers claimed that this fiancee or wife
                           of a Highlander fighting in <placeName>India</placeName> had
                           clairvoyantly predicted <persName corresp="#havelock">Havelock</persName>'s capture of
                              <placeName>Lucknow</placeName> from the <orgName>Sepoys</orgName>. The
                           story was rapidly discredited, but informed many imaginative
                           representations, including <persName>Rymer</persName>'s penny dreadful
                           and <persName>Dion Boucicault</persName>'s play <title>Highland
                              Jessie</title>, which opened in <placeName>New York</placeName>'s

                           to being a heroine incur a great deal of mockery, and she is jealous of
